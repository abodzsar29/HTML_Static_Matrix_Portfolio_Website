Matrix themed Portfolio Website Project - NOTE: THE WEBSITE IS ONLY OPTIMISED FOR 1920 * 1080 RESOLUTION

This repository contains all of the source files which I utilised to make my first portfolio website showcasing my web development skills with a hands-on product.

Standard HTML5 was used without a framework to scructure the web page, and CSS3 was used to achieve the styling of the product. JavaScript, its library jQuery and CSS3 was implemented to make certain elements interactive or animated. I also imported the GreenSock Animation Platform to make objects fade, bounce or float. To improve the overall performance, I could have used GSAP's DrawSVGPlugin instead of jQuery's DrawSVG plugin to draw out the tree which appears when the "Skills" dropdown menu is clicked. This would have increased the loading speed and would have made the website lighter.

The website was not utilised as my personal portfolio website due to not deeming it attractive enough, as well as, because the site has compatibility issues with screens larger than 1920 * 1080 pixels. This is caused by the usage of the CSS grid layout mechanism as the base for the entire website. 

Comments have been added for easier maintenance and better navigation throughout the code.
